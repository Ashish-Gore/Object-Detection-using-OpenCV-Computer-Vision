# Face & Eye Detection

Objectives:
-  Face & Eye Detection in the input images using OpenCV Library.

Working of Haar Cascade:
-A Haar Cascade feature considers adjacent rectangular regions at a specific location in a detection window, sums up the pixel intensities in each region and calculates the difference between these sums. This difference is then used to categorize subsections of an image.

**Tuning Cascade Classifiers
ourClassifier.detectMultiScale(input image, Scale Factor , Min Neighbors)**

**Scale Factor** Specifies how much we reduce the image size each time we scale. E.g. in face detection we typically use 1.3. This means we reduce the image by 30% each time itâ€™s scaled. Smaller values, like 1.05 will take longer to compute, but will increase the rate of detection.
**Min Neighbors** Specifies the number of neighbors each potential window should have in order to consider it a positive detection. Typically set between 3-6. It acts as sensitivity setting, low values will sometimes detect multiples faces over a single face. High values will ensure less false positives, but you may miss some faces.
